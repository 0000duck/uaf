Dependencies
============

To build the UAF C++ libraries, you'll need:

 * the [OPC UA C++ SDK of Unified Automation](http://www.unified-automation.com) 
   (any version will do: the binary version, the source code version, and the free demo version)
 * OpenSSL 
   (will most likely be installed already when you installed the Unified Automation SDK)
 * CMake, the cross-platform build system
 * C++ compiler: GCC for Linux, and Microsoft Visual Studio for Windows (Express version will do)

If you also want to build the Python wrappers, you additionally need:

 * Python
 * SWIG, the Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator

Finally, if you want to
 
 * generate the C++ documentation, you'll also need Doxygen
 * generate the Python documentation, you'll also need Sphinx
 * run the unit tests, you'll need at least Python 2.7
